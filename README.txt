CRYPTO CLUSTERING

OBJECTIVE: Obtain data from csv file in order to analyze the pricing data of various cryptocurrencies to determine the best predictor of price (24hrs vs 7 days price change). Initially applying k method and then moving to PCA to obtain the best agglomeration of crypto data by fewer number of attributes. The original data set had 7 attributes (24h, 7d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 200d and 1y). 

METHODS USED: Python code for K-means, Elbow Curve and PCA sklearn library

CONCLUSION: PCA facilitates and simplifies data analysis by reducing the number of data attributes to a meaningful and statistically reasonable number of attributes that allow for analysis.
